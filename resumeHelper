I am going to create a set of questions.

i need a typescript react component  tht outputs questions with a text area for input



Here are the questions or prompts. They may have additional notes underneath.


- Enter your position role
  - Give as many keywords as possible when it comes to the roles.
  - This will help with the system prompt generation
- Enter the job description of position you are applying for:
- Enter additional details about the job you are applying for:

- Enter the skills section of your resume
- Enter education section of your resume
- Enter the certifications/lincense section of your resume
- Enter the experience section of your resume
  - users should be able to add multiple job experience descriptions. This should come in the form of some button or trigger that adds another text area with experience description
  - + (Add Job With descriptions)
  - The user can either paste their raw data 
- Enter details of projects
  - include the option to add more projects
  - users should be able to add multiple projects. This should come in the form of some button or trigger that adds another text area with the project information
- Enter additional details you would like to include about your work or yourself that should be factored in
